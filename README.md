# Tic-Tac-Toe with AI

## Overview

Challenge an AI in the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe! This implementation features an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm, ensuring that it always makes the best possible move.

## Disclaimer

The graphical user interface (GUI) used in this project is sourced externally. All credits for the GUI belong to the original author(s). This interface is essential for running the game, but please note that it is not my original creation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the Pygame library:

```bash
   pip install pygame
bash```



## How to Play

1. Run the game using:




2. Once the game window opens, choose whether you'd like to play as 'X' or 'O'.
3. Make your move by clicking on an empty cell.
4. The AI opponent will take its turn.
5. The game ends when there's a winner or if there's a tie (when the board is full).
6. To play again, click the "Play Again" button.

## Technical Details

- `archivo1.py` handles the graphical interface and user interactions. It sets up the game board and captures user moves.

- `archivo2.py` contains the logic behind the Tic-Tac-Toe game and the AI's Minimax algorithm. It defines functions that determine valid actions, the result of a move, and whether a game state is terminal.
